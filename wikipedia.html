    	<p>At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh. Needa marked his debut as a child actor.During the shoot of Poratam (1983) at Vauhini Studios, after watching Babu on the sets, director Kodi Ramakrishna suggested to Krishna that he cast Babu in the role of the protagonist's brother. Initially terrified, Babu agreed to act in the film after being persuaded by the film's crew.He went on to act as a child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989). Babu then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990). Later, he continued his college studies.

In 1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the film Raja Kumarudu, directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and co-starring Priety Zinta. The film was commercially successful, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.The film had a 50-day run in 80 centres and a 100-day run in 44 centres. Raja Kumarudu collected a share of ₹10.51 Crores from Andhra Pradesh.It was dubbed in Hindi as Prince No. 1 and in Tamil as Kaadhal Vennila.The film was again dubbed and released theatrically in Tamil during January 2017 as Ivan Oru Thunichalkaran.He received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut. He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi. Following their poor performance at the box office, Babu starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari the next year. He called Murari an important film in his career and the role he played in it one of his favourites. Murari was a commercial success and earned him the Nandi Special Jury Award.Though his 2002 releases Takkari Donga and Bobby performed poorly at the box office, Babu received his second Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in the former.
Babu had two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla, which went on to become the highest grossing Telugu film of the year collecting ₹23 crores at the box office.He won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.The other release was Teja's Nijam co-starring Rakshita.

  <p>During the shoot of B. Gopal's Vamsi at Australia, Babu began to date his co-star Namrata Shirodkar. After being in a relationship for four years, they decided to get married, and Manjula convinced Krishna in favour of their decision.They were married on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu. The couple's first child was born on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.The boy, named Gautham Krishna, was a premature baby and was in critical condition during his birth. His condition turned stable after the doctors treated him in time.On 20 July 2012, Shirodkar gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.

   <p>Manjula produced his next film, Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast was commercially successful, Naani flopped at the box office. He received the Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.The failure of Naani depressed both Babu and Manjula, who took a small break in Goa before resuming their other commitments.He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu, co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.Athadu became one of the highest-grossing films of the year. The film was a commercially profitable venture for the producers and distributors. The film benefited Babu's career as he won the Nandi Best Actor Award for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.Athadu collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box office. Idlebrain gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.

Babu collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.Made on a budget of ₹10 crore and shot within six months, Pokiri became the highest grossing Telugu film of all time by the end of its run, and was screened at the 7th IIFA Awards held in Dubai. Babu received praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing more questionable recent career choices". He won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the second time.Pokiri grossed ₹67 crore at the box office.That same year, his next film, Sainikudu, co-starring Trisha, was released amid huge expectations but flopped at the box office.
The following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi, co-starring Amrita Rao marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by Mahesh Babu's's brother Ramesh. UTV Motion Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu film venture.In 2008, Babu provided voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram Srinivas

After Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for seven months; two months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was unintentionally extended for two years due to several delays. During this time, Babu's grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was worried about Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so long.Upon release, Khaleja received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure in India. However, it managed to perform well at the overseas box office. Rediff gave a 3 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless. The film is considered one of the "25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.</p>
